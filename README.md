The code in these exercises was created as part of week 8 of the Math
for Data Science course, MSDS 400, at Northwestern University.  The
first exercise was taken from the Society of Actuaries Probability
practice exercises.  The exercise with a parabola was a simple example
that I made up.  Python libraries used include scipy, numpy and 
matplotlib.
